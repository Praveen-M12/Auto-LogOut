I have implemented a welcome page and a login page for auto logout in this mini-project. 
For example, when users log in to the website but do not spend any time there, 
the auto-logout feature kicks in, so I have to ask them to log in again.

I utilized the fundamentals of 
JavaScript, 
HTML,
CSS. 

The implementation of this feature presents no difficulties at all.
